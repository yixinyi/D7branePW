\section{D7-brane}

We consider a probe D7-brane, whose worldvolume is induced from the target space with 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ansatz}
 \theta = \theta(c), \quad \phi=\phi_0\equiv\frac{(2 n + 1)\pi}{2}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the induced metric, from \eqref{eq:PWmetric} with $d\theta = \theta'(c) dc$ and $d\phi=0$, is:
\begin{align}\label{eq:PWmetric}
ds_{D7}^2 =
\Omega^2 dx_\mu dx^\mu 
- (V_c^2 +V_\theta^2 \theta'(c)^2)\, dc^2 - V_1^2 \sigma_1^2 - V_2^2 (\sigma_2^2 + \sigma_3^2),
\end{align}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Action}

Our particular choice of $\phi_0$ is because
\begin{equation}
 P[B_{(2)}] = 0,
\end{equation}
which simplifies our problem, and further we assume no worldvolume gauge field, $F = 0$. 
Then the D7-brane action is simply
\begin{align}
 S & = -T_7 \int_\mathcal{M} d^8\xi \, e^{-P[\Phi] } \sqrt{-\det g} +
 T_7\int _\mathcal{M} P[C_{(8)}].
\end{align}

Let us focus on the $C_{(8)}$ term, which was deemed as vanishing in the previous papers, \cite{Albash:2011nw} and \cite{Evans:2005ti}. The problem was that these authors did not consider the dilaton term in the string frame for the metric, which effectively cancels the vanishing factor, leading to a finite value for the pullback of the form. We decided to compute it explicitly and the full result, up to an exact form, is shown in the appendix \ref{sec:backgroundFields}. We can quickly see that it is nonzero for our ansatz $\phi_0$ in \eqref{eq:ansatz}. However, $P[C_{(8)}]$ term can be much simpler, as we will see in the following. First, we can show explicitly that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C8id}
 [d C_{(8)}]_{\phi_0} = d [C_{(8)}]_{\phi_0},
\end{equation}
The former is
\begin{equation}
 [d C_{(8)}]_{\phi_0}  = \dfrac{A^2 \sin\theta \cos^3(\theta)}{\left(c^2-1\right)^2} 
\sigma_1 \wedge \sigma_2 \wedge \sigma_3 \wedge dc  \wedge dx_0 \wedge dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3 \wedge d\theta,
\end{equation}
and the result of integrating over $\theta$ can be identified with
\begin{equation}
[C_{(8)}]_{\phi_0} = \dfrac{A^2 \cos^4\theta}{4 \left(c^2-1\right)^2} \sigma_1 \wedge \sigma_2 \wedge \sigma_3 \wedge dc \wedge dx_0 \wedge dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3,
\end{equation}
via \eqref{eq:C8id}. The full pullback is obtained by just replacing $\theta$ by $\theta(c)$.


Now, we can write the action in a more explicit way:
\begin{align}\label{eq:ActionWithTheta'}
 S = & -T_7 \int_\mathcal{M} d^8\xi \, \dfrac{A \cos^3\theta (c) \sqrt{c X_1(c, \theta(c))}}{\left(c^2-1\right)^3} \sqrt{\left(c^2-1\right)^2 A \, \theta '(c)^2+c} \nonumber \\
     & +T_7\int _\mathcal{M} d^8\xi \, \dfrac{A^2 \cos^4\theta(c)}{4 \left(c^2-1\right)^2}.
\end{align}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Kappa symmetry projector}

The kappa symmetry projector for our configuration is:
\begin{align}
\Gamma = - \dfrac{ \gamma_{(8)} \mathcal{I} }{\sqrt{-\det g}},
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
 \gamma_{(8)} = - V_x^4 V_1 V_2^2 \Gamma_{1 2 3 4 7 8 9}( V_c \Gamma_5 +  V_{\theta} \theta'(c) \Gamma_6), 
\end{align}
where we used capital gammas to denote de gamma matrices in the local frame, see appendix \ref{sec:localframe}.

Combined with the chirality condition, which in our convention is: 
\begin{equation}
 \Gamma_{11} \epsilon = -\epsilon, \quad 
 \Gamma_{11} \equiv \Gamma_{12345678910},
\end{equation}
the supersymmetric condition \eqref{eq:susyCondition} can be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
 \Gamma_{11} \Gamma \epsilon = \epsilon.
\end{equation}
The combined projector is
\begin{align} \label{eq:newProjector}
  \mathcal{P}' \equiv \Gamma_{11} \Gamma  = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+\xi^2}}(1- i \xi  \Gamma_{510}), \quad 
   \xi \equiv  \dfrac{V_\theta}{V_c} \theta'(c),
\end{align}
where we have applied $\Gamma_{610} \epsilon = -i \epsilon$ since we can show that $\mathcal{P}_- \epsilon =0$. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Supersymmetric condition}

For the Killing spinor \eqref{eq:KillingSpinor}, the invertible operator in \eqref{eq:susyCondition0} is:
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{O} &= \exp{\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\Gamma_{56} \right)} \exp{\left(-\frac{\phi}{2}\, \Gamma_{610} \right)} \exp{\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\Gamma_{710} \mathcal{K} \right)} \\
 \mathcal{O}^{-1} &=  \exp{\left(-\frac{\beta}{2}\Gamma_{710} \mathcal{K} \right)} 
 \exp{\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\, \Gamma_{610} \right)} 
 \exp{\left(-\frac{\alpha}{2}\Gamma_{56} \right)}.
\end{align}


The kappa symmetry projector contains the operator $\mathcal{I}$, which can be replaced as follows (see notation in \ref{sec:KillingSpinor}):
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{I}\eta =-i \eta = \Gamma_{610} \eta,
\end{equation}
where we used $\mathcal{P}_- \eta =0$ in the last step. 

Then, \eqref{eq:susyCondition0} reduces to:
\begin{equation}
 \Pi_{-} \mathcal{O}^{-1} \gamma_{(8)} \mathcal{O} \Gamma_{610} \Pi_{+}  = 0.
\end{equation}
which, after manipulating the gamma matrices, gives:
\begin{equation}
i V_1 V_2^2 V_x^4 \Pi_- \Gamma_{6 8 9 10} \mathcal{K} \sin\beta \left(V_c \sin\alpha - V_\theta \cos\alpha \, \theta'(c)\right) = 0
\end{equation}
Therefore, the condition our configuration must satisfy in order to preserve supersymmetry is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:susyConditionTheta}
 \theta'(c) = \dfrac{V_c}{V_\theta} \tan\alpha = \dfrac{c \, \tan\theta(c)}{c^2-1} .
\end{equation}


One can repeat the analysis of \eqref{eq:susyCondition0} for the other projector $\mathcal{P}_{\pm}$, and it will give the same condition \eqref{eq:susyConditionTheta}.


The projector \eqref{eq:newProjector} at the solution \eqref{eq:susyConditionTheta} is simply
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}' = \cos \alpha - i \sin \alpha \, \Gamma_{510},
\end{equation}
since $ \xi =  \tan \alpha $.
No more projectors are found, therefore, our embedding is 1/2-BPS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Equation of motion}

As a consistency check for our results, the equation of motion from the action \eqref{eq:ActionWithTheta'} is fulfilled with the solution \eqref{eq:susyConditionTheta}. In particular, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:eom}
-\left.EL[\mathcal{L}_{DBI}]\right|_\text{solution} = EL[\mathcal{L}_{WZ}] = \dfrac{A^2 \sin\theta \cos^3(\theta)}{\left(c^2-1\right)^2},
\end{align}
where we have the Euler-Lagrange operator:
\begin{equation}
 EL[\mathcal{L}] = 
 \left(\dfrac{\pd }{\pd \theta(c)} -\dfrac{\pd }{\pd c}  \dfrac{\pd }{\pd \theta'(c)} \right) \mathcal{L}.
\end{equation}
Hence, \eqref{eq:eom} is another proof for the non-vanishing WZ term.




\subsection{Solution}

The solution to the differential equation \eqref{eq:susyConditionTheta} is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:susyConditionSolution}
\boxed{\sin\theta(c) = L \sqrt{c^2-1}; \quad 1 < c \leq \sqrt{1+L^{-2}}, \quad L < 1},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is an integration constant, which is proportional to the mass of the fundamental matter (or quark) field in the dual field theory, as we explain next. The upper bound of $c$ is set by the maximum of the sine.

In near boundary limit, $c \approx 1 + z^2/2$, our solution reduces to the exact solution found in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background, as revealed in \cite{Karch:2005ms}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
 \sin\theta(z) = L z.
\end{equation}
As \cite{Karch:2005ms} explains, in the flat embedding space limit, this embedding describes a planar D-brane located at a constant distance away $L$ from the stack of N D3-branes:
\begin{equation}
 L = \lim_{z \rightarrow 0 } \frac{1}{z} \sin\theta(z)
\end{equation}
and this distance is proportional to the quark mass $m$:
\begin{equation}
 L = \dfrac{m}{2 \pi ls^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Holographic renormalization}

The action evaluated at the solution \eqref{eq:susyConditionSolution} is:
\begin{align}\label{eq:ActionAtSolution}
 S = & -T_7 \int_\mathcal{M} d^8\xi \, 
 \frac{c A \left(\left(c^2-1\right) L^2-1\right) \left(c \left(c^2-1\right) L^2 A-\left(c^2-1\right) L^2+1\right)}{\left(c^2-1\right)^3}
 \nonumber \\
     & +T_7\int _\mathcal{M} d^8\xi \, 
 \frac{A^2 \left(\left(c^2-1\right) L^2-1\right)^2}{4 \left(c^2-1\right)^2},
\end{align}
where the integration of $c$ is the range shown in \eqref{eq:susyConditionSolution}.

The action is IR-divergent, as we can expect, since the boundary geometry is asymptotically AdS. The divergent terms are:
\begin{align}
 S_{IR} = T_7 \int_\mathcal{M} d^7\xi 
        \left( \frac{1}{4 \epsilon ^4} +\frac{-L^2+\log \left(\frac{\epsilon }{2}\right)+1}{2 \epsilon ^2}-\frac{1}{4} \log ^2\left(\frac{\epsilon }{2}\right)+\frac{\log (\epsilon )}{8} \right).
\end{align}
The method to handle them is the holographic renormalization, and the counterterms for our configuration are covered by the results derived in the section 4 of \cite{Karch:2005ms}. The chiral condensate must be vanishing too, as it is prohibited by supersymmetry, \cite{Babington:2003vm}. This disagrees with \cite{Albash:2011nw}, however, as we already mentioned, their logarithmic term in the embeding profile is incorrect, and removing this term, the condensate evaluated at the background is exactly the one in \cite{Karch:2005ms}, and it is zero.
