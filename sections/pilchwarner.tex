\section{Pilch-Warner supergravity}\label{sec:PWB}
The Pilch-Warner solution to the type II supergravity equations was originally found in \cite{Pilch:2000ue}. 
In this section, let us review its metric, the background fields and the Killing spinors, the latter first derived in \cite{Pilch:2003jg}.
