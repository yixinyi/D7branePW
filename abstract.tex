A new supersymmetric D7–brane embedding in the Pilch–Warner gravitational background is found exactly, by solving the supersymmetric condition. 
In the dual holographic picture, our setting corresponds to adding a quenched fundamental matter sector to  $\mathcal{N}=2^*$  super Yang–Mills theory, at zero temperature. We show that previous results in the same setting are missing the Wess-Zumino term in the D-brane action, and how our results complete the picture.
